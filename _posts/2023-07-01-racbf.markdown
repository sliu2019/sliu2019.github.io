One major drawback of prior work is that it cannot satisfactorily handle model uncertainty. We designed an optimization algorithm for generating robust-adaptive safe controllers, which account for uncertainty without producing over-conservative behavior. Ultimately, our controller allows for 55% better control performance while still ensuring safety as compared to popular baselines.
