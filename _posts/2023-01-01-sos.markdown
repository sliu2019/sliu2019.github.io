Safety indices, also called control barrier functions (CBFs), are popularly used for safe reactive control. However, for all but the simplest systems, it's hard to find a valid CBF in the first place. We devise an optimization algorithm that can automatically generate a CBF for any moderate-sized, polynomial-equivalent system. This includes simplified vehicles and manipulators.
