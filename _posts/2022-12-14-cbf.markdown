Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide a simple way to construct a provably safe controller. However, the CBF itself must be carefully designed so that the resulting controller wonâ€™t exceed input limits, which would violate safety. This design problem is well-known within controls, but still has few solutions for high-dimensional nonlinear systems. We propose a neural CBF and self-supervised training scheme that can be used for high-dimensional nonlinear systems.
