The system dynamics of robots can sometimes change online (e.g. as the environment changes). To deal with this, we consider adapting a neural dynamics model online. We propose to meta-learn a model initialization and update it online with gradient descent. This scheme can adapt very well after just a few samples of data. We show that a legged millirobot using this scheme can adapt to dynamics that change with terrain, payload, and wear-and-tear.
